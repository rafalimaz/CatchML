<h1>Welcome to CatchML</h1>
<p>CatchML is a textual Domain Specific Language (DSL) which is specially tailored for modeling context aware exception handling in Ubiquitous
systems and automatically verify consistence of the exception models. Its uses the <a href="http://www.great.ufc.br/~lincoln/JCAEHV/" target="_blank">JCAEHV</a>, a java API for
modeling and verify context aware exception handling models. The language is a result of my Master's Degree obtained on 2013 and the dissertation about it can be downloaded on the 
<a href="http://mdcc.ufc.br/teses/doc_download/218-187-rafael-de-lima" target="_blank">official repository</a>.
By using CatchML we can reduce the effort and time to model context-aware  exception handling and increase the robusteness of the system by verifying the models. 
It has been designed to provide a high-level abstraction and to be an easy to learn, so exception handling models can be specified by non-developers users.
