<h1>Welcome to CatchML</h1>
<p>CatchML is a textual Domain Specific Language (DSL) which is
specially tailored for modeling context aware exception handling in Ubiquitous
systems and automatically verify consistence of the model using <a href="http://www.great.ufc.br/~lincoln/JCAEHV/">JCAEHV</a>, a java API for
modeling and verify context aware exception handling models. Using CatchML we can reduce 
the effort and time to model context-aware exception handling and increase the robusteness
of the system by verifying the models. It has been designed to provide a high-level abstraction and to be an
easy to learn, so exception handling models can be specified by non-developers
users. The language grammar generated by <a href="http://www.antlr3.org/works/">ANTLRworks</a> can be seen <a href="images/catchml_antlrgrammar.png">here</a>. A Xtext Syntax
Graph of the language can be seen <a href="images/catchml_xtextsyntaxgraph.png">here</a>.</p>
