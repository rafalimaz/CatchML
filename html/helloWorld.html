<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p> Here we have a hello world exception handling model. Suppose that the context model is composed by two single 
context information: Hello and World. So, the system must be carried to a state that both Hello and World
are satisfied. However, if one of them are not valid, an exception is raised. </p>
<p>The system is modeled with two exceptions: "noHelloException" and "noWorldException. The scopes handles these
two exceptions carrying the system to a state that both Hello and World are satisfied.</p>
