# [CatchML - Context Aware excepTion Handling Modeling Language](http://rafalimaz.github.io/CatchML)


CatchML is a textual Domain Specific Language (DSL) which is specially tailored for modeling context aware exception handling in Ubiquitous systems and automatically verify consistence of the exception models. Its uses the JCAEHV, a java API for modeling and verify context aware exception handling models. The language is a result of my Master's Degree obtained on 2013. By using CatchML we can reduce the effort and time to model context-aware exception handling and increase the robusteness of the system by verifying the models. It has been designed to provide a high-level abstraction and to be an easy to learn, so exception handling models can be specified by non-developers users.
